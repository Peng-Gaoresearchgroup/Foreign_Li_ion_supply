# Type 2 of redox-active center containing a series of electrochemically active molecules
![My Local Image](../Images/Type2.png 'Type 2 of redox-active center containing a series of electrochemically active')

A redox-active center type containing lithium sulfinate (1), lithium vinylsulfinate (2), lithium  allylsulfinate (3), lithium ethynylsulfinate (4), lithium 3-oxo-sulfinate (5), lithium 2-oxy-sulfinate (6), lithium 2-amino-sulfinate (7), lithium 2-thio-sulfinate (8), lithium sulfite (9), and lithium propargylsulfinate (10). They are grouped into the same category because these functional groups undergo the same reaction route to release a free Li ion, a SO2 gas molecule and a radical.
