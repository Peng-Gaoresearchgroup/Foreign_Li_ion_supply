# Type 6 of redox-active center containing a series of electrochemically active molecules
![My Local Image](../Images/Type6.png 'Type 6 of redox-active center containing a series of electrochemically active')

A redox-active center type containing dilithium hydrazine (1), dilithium diacylhydrazine (2), dilithium acylhydrazine (3), dilithium diathiohydrazine (4), dilithium thiohydrazine (5), dilithium iminomethylhydrazine (6), dilithium oxy-acyl-iminomethylhydrazine (7), dilithium oxy-acyl-acylhydrazine (8), and dilithium oxy-acyl-thiohydrazine (9). They are grouped into the same category because these functional groups undergo the same reaction route to release two free Li ion and a nitrogen nitrogen radical.
