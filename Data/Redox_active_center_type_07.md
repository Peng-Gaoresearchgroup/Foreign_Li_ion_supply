A redox-active center type containing lithium alcohol (1), lithium allylalcohol (2), lithium propargylalcohol (3), lithium 3-oxo-alcohol (4), and lithium 3-oxy-3-oxo-alcohol (5). They are grouped into the same category because these functional groups undergo the same reaction route to release two free Li ion and a oxygen radical.
