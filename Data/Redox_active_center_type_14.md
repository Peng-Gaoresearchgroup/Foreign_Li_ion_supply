A redox-active center type containing lithium pentafluorophosphate (1), lithium 2-oxy-pentafluorophosphate (2), lithium vinylpentafluorophosphate (3), and lithium 2-amino-pentafluorophosphate (4). They are grouped into the same category because these functional groups undergo the same reaction route to release a free Li ion and a radical.
