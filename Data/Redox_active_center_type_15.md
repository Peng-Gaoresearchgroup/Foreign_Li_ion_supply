# Type 15 of redox-active center containing a series of electrochemically active molecules
![My Local Image](../Images/Type15.png 'Type 15 of redox-active center containing a series of electrochemically active')

A redox-active center type containing lithium trifluoroborate (1), lithium allyltrifluoroborate (2), lithium propargyltrifluoroborate (3), lithium 2-oxy-trifluoroborate (4), lithium 2-thio-trifluoroborate (5), and lithium 2-amino-trifluoroborate (6). They are grouped into the same category because these functional groups undergo the same reaction route to release a free Li ion , a BF3 gas molecule and a radical.
