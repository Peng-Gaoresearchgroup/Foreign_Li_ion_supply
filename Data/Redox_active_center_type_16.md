A redox-active center type containing lithium phosphonofluoridate (1), lithium 2-amino-phosphonofluoridate (2), lithium vinylphosphonofluoridate (3), and lithium 2-oxy-phosphonofluoridate (4). They are grouped into the same category because these functional groups undergo the same reaction route to release a free Li ion and a radical.
