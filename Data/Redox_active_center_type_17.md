A redox-active center type containing dilithium 4-monocatecholate (1), dilithium 3-monocatecholate (2), dilithium 3,4-monocatecholate (3), dilithium 4,5-monocatecholate (4), dilithium 3,6-monocatecholate (5), dilithium 3,5-monocatecholate (6), dilithium 3,4,5-monocatecholate (7), dilithium 3,5,6-monocatecholate (8) and dilithium 3,4,5,6-monocatecholate (9). They are grouped into the same category because these functional groups undergo the same reaction route to release two free Li ion and two oxygen  radical.
