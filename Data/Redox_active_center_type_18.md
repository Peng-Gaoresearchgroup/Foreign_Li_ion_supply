![My Local Image](../Images/Type18.png 'Type 18 of redox-active center containing a series of electrochemically active')

A redox-active center type containing dilithium 2-hydroquinone (1), dilithium 2,4-hydroquinone (2), dilithium 2,6-hydroquinone (3), dilithium 2,5-hydroquinone (4), dilithium 2,3,6-hydroquinone (5), and dilithium 2,3,5,6-hydroquinone (6). They are grouped into the same category because these functional groups undergo the same reaction route to release two free Li ion and two oxygen radical.
